## 📊 Strategy Logic (Example)

The bot:
- Monitors stock prices using the Alpaca paper trading account.
- Calculates short-term and long-term moving averages.
- Buys when short-term crosses long-term upwards (Golden Cross).
- Sells when the opposite happens (Death Cross).
- Avoids trading outside market hours.

> You can modify the logic to suit your preferred strategy: RSI, MACD, News Sentiment, etc.
